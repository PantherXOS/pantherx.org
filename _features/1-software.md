![PantherX Desktop](/assets/images/px-desktop@0.5x.jpg)

On PantherX, all your applications and updates come from one of two sources, similar to an App-Store.

Our **primary store** lists thousands of officially approved, rigorously tested applications and plugins and can be accessed trough the **Software** application.

Our **secondary store**, specifically designed for developers and enterprise, lists all remaining applications, that are either awaiting approval, or are not suitable for the primary store. The 3rd party store is only accessible via command line or executed trough developer distributed {% include tooltip.html keyword="app packages" description="App Packages are comparable to an installer you might find on Windows or MacOS, with the difference that they are tiny in size and obtain their application code from our secondary store. That means, after installation, they remain up to date, with the rest of the system." %}.

Unlike other stores, registration is optional, advertisements and trackers are prohibited and everything has been tested with PantherX, on {% include tooltip.html keyword="Panther Alpha" description="Panther Alpha is a computer, smaller than your wallet, designed specifically for PantherX." %}.

### Online Accounts

PantherX connects to the most popular services out of the box. It's easy to set-up your Gmail account, get files synced from Dropbox, start a new conversation on WhatsApp or connect to a fast, privacy-first VPN provider.

Online accounts can be added, edited and monitored from a unified interface. This covers everything from the essentials such as mail, contacts, calendar, file synchronisation and various chat services, to Cryptocurrency wallets and API credentials to access popular exchange services.

#### Panther Hub

Panther Hub shows all your connected online accounts, their status and related notifications like messages and even account movements, depending on which services you have configured and enabled.
