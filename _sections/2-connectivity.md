title: Connectivity
---

PantherX allows seamless communication with other Panther Alpha users, which enables file synchronisation, video chat and remote login, all without registering any accounts, and both to local, and remote PantherX powered systems. Beyond that, PantherNet enables the hosting, and sharing of websites, including small communities, between any number of Panther users, even without traditional internet access.

### Online Accounts

Online accounts can be added, edited and monitored from a unified interface. This covers everything from the essentials such as mail, contacts, calendar, file synchronisation and various chat services, to Cryptocurrency wallets and API credentials to access exchange services.

All secrets, including passwords, token's and API keys are encrypted and access to individual secrets is limited to the application that requires it, and which has been approved during the account set-up.

### Networking

Networking has been designed to be as easy to use, and transparent as possible. A quick overview shows how you're connected to the internet, and whether you run additional privacy features such as VPN's, Proxies or even TOR.


With one click, you deny all applications internet access, unless you're connected to a specified network or set individual rules, depending on your location and thread level.

#### Profiles

For additional flexibility, Networking Profiles allow you to define connection parameters, based on your current location, and the network you're connected to. With one click, you can deny internet access to all but essential applications, or design custom profiles, that cover your specific needs.

### PantherNet

The term PantherNet covers all Panther to Panther related connectivity features, including the direct exchange of messages and files, the synchronisation of any number of Panther devices, and offline-internet, with automatic resource allocation between any number of Panther devices, connected by any number of ways.

#### Self-Contained Infrastructure

PantherX has been designed to perform great in scenarios where you need to bootstrap a self-contained infrastructure with any number of Panther Alpha, with or without central management and even without pre-existing networking infrastructure.

To initiate a new, self-contained infrastructure, all you need is a Panther Alpha on which you create the initiation profile which defines each, new Panther's responsibility - for example: DNS, file or application server or staff and student computers.

### Remote Access

Because all Panther Alpha are identical, and come with the same core software, PantherX offers the most robust, fast, remote-login feature ever made. This allows you to remotely access your Panther Alpha, using any other Panther Alpha, from anywhere in the world, as long as they are connected. All you need is your password and a matching Panther Key.
