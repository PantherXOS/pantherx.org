PantherX automatically and transparently blocks all advertising networks, trackers and malicious sites, system wide. No matter what browser or application you are using, PantherX OS protects you automatically. Additional features such as pre-configured VPN and proxy Provider, further help improve your privacy, when you need it most.

### Auditable Open Source Code

PantherX OS is based on GNU Guix, which has been in development since early 2013 and already found application in universities and high performance computing environments. PantherX OS, including all Panther applications, are open source, and anybody may review, enhance or re-use Panther software. In fact, we encourage adoption in other projects.
