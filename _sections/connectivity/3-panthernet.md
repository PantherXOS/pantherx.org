PantherNet powers all Panther to Panther connectivity features, including the direct exchange of messages and files, the synchronization of any number of Panther devices, and {% include tooltip.html keyword="offline internet" description="The offline internet refers to any number of Panther Alpha, connected in a network, forming their own internet, with related services such as web-hosting and message exchange." %}, with automatic resource allocation between any number of Panther devices, connected by any number of ways.

### Self-Contained Infrastructure

PantherX has been designed to perform great in scenarios where you need to bootstrap a self-contained {% include tooltip.html keyword="infrastructure" description="Infrastructure is really a more fancy word for a bunch (or thousands!) of Panther Alpha, connected either directly, or via the Internet, to form a new, independent network." %} with any number of Panther Alpha, with or without central management and even without pre-existing networking infrastructure.

To initiate a new, self-contained infrastructure, all you need is a Panther Alpha on which you create the {% include tooltip.html keyword="initiation profile" description="The initiation profile is basically a configuration file, based on which a new Panther Alpha configures itself. That means, you can have any number of initiation profiles, to cover any number of scenarios - for example, a file-server, a web-server, or just - your new Desktop" %}, which defines each, new Panther's responsibility.
