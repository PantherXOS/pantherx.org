PantherX allows seamless communication with other Panther Alpha users, which enables file synchronisation, video chat and remote login, all without registering any accounts, and both to local, and remote PantherX powered systems. Beyond that, PantherNet enables the hosting and sharing of websites and small communities like Mastodon, between any number of Panther users, even without traditional internet access.
