Networking has been designed to be as easy to use, and transparent as possible. A quick overview shows how you're connected to the internet, and whether additional privacy features, including OpenVPN, {% include tooltip.html keyword="WireGuard" description="WireGuard is a very simple, yet incredibly fast, modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. WireGuard offers a superior and potentially more secure experience compared to OpenVPN." %}, Proxy or Tor, are running.

### Networking Profiles

For additional flexibility, networking profiles allow you to define connection parameters, based on your current location, and the network you're connected to.

With a few clicks, you can deny internet access to all but essential applications, or design your own profile, to cover more individual needs.

### Built-in VPN and Proxy

Furthermore, PantherX provides tools that help you set-up your own VPN or proxy server, on any other Panther Alpha, or almost any Linux powered cloud server, anywhere in the world.

If you prefer to stick with a reputable provider, select one of many, pre-configured VPN providers, supporting a number of protocols, including OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec and stunnel tunnels.
