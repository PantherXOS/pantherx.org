title: Security
---

PantherX OS builds on Linux, which already powers the majority of our today's infrastructure, and various super computers. The whole system has been designed to protect your data and itself, even in hostile environments. Take advantage of various security tweaks, such as restricting internet access, or limiting sensitive communication to specific networks.

### Firewall

The built-in Firewall protects your computer both on the system and application level, in- and out-bound. Unused ports are blocked by default, and applications that shouldn't connect, don't.

### Versioned Snapshots

PantherX enforces your system configuration, and takes snapshots whenever you install and update software, or make system related changes. Should anything ever go wrong, and your system refuses to boot, you can roll-back to any number of previous snapshots, automatically, within seconds and without losing any of your recent work.

### Visibility & Transparency

PantherX OS keeps track of the current system state, and informs you about any changes. With a clear overview of how you're connected to your network, what services are running and which applications are allowed to access the internet, and how, when and how much they utilize the connection.
