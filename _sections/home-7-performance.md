### The latest in tech

With PantherX, we've taken a good look at what's available on the market, and how we can utilize the latest tech, to make the best Operating System yet. Whereas others have to support 20 year old software, we have the opportunity for a fresh start, and build on new, exciting, yet stable new developments.

### (Ready) for Gaming

PantherX doesn't yet spot the full-range of Games you'd find on other, more established OS's, however it takes less than 5 minutes to install and start into Android, where you can play away, on the big screen, with 100% performance.

### Software engineered for the hardware beneath

PantherX OS, has been from ground up, designed to run on Panther Alpha, a powerful desktop computer, not bigger than a pack of cigarettes, that runs on less than 4W. All you need is a display, a mouse & keyboard and some kind of source of power, preferably a wall-plug, but power-banks are known to work as well.

When you power on your Panther Alpha for the first time, you are greeted with a system, that works right-away, and for years to come, without slow-down, or failure.
