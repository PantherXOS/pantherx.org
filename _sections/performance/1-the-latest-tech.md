### The latest in tech

With PantherX, we've taken a good look at what's available on the market, and how we can utilize the latest tech, to make the best Operating System yet. Whereas others have to support 20 year old software, we have the opportunity for a fresh start, and build on new, exciting, yet stable technologies.

### (Ready) for Gaming

PantherX doesn't yet spot the full range of games you'd find on other, more established platforms, however it takes less than 5 minutes to install Steam, or other gaming platforms, to get rolling.
