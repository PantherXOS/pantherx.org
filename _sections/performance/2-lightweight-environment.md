Not too long ago, the average Desktop PC had 16MB working memory - it was able to accommodate both the desktop environment, and all applications that you are running. Today's hardware often ships with 16, or even 32GB or Memory as OS and desktop environments have grown flashier, hungrier and a lot more distracting.

With PantherX, we put a stop to this.

**System Requirements**

- Intel, AMD, or ARM CPU with min. 2x1.6GHz
- 512MB memory, recommended: 2GB Memory
- 10GB of hard disk space

PantherX is designed to run best on Panther Alpha.
