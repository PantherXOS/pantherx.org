Say _good bye_ to a system, application and sites that constantly monitor you. On PantherX, there's no tracking, and 3rd party apps and sites, are blocked from keeping an eye on you, reliably.

### Application Firewall

PantherX features two firewall, one to protect your system, and one to keep applications from "chatting".

### Recovery

Some of our most precious memories are often stored on our computer, and as it happens, things go wrong, when you least expect it. Once you start using PantherX, on Panther Alpha, you will stop worrying about _what if_.

If anything ever goes wrong, PantherX roll-back features allow you to return to a previous, working state within seconds. In the worst-case scenario, it's easy to recover from a recent backup.
