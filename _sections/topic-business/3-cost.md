Few of us have thousands of € to spend on software licenses and upgrades. Running a traditional PC for a couple of years, can easily add up - there's the OS license, Office license, antivirus and yearly renewal fees.

On PantherX, you have access to over 10,000 quality, open source applications, that have been developed by both community and big business, to suit your every need. In fact, most PantherX users, will likely never spend a single cent on Software.
