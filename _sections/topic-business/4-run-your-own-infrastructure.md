**Would you give a thief your money, and the keys to your house?**. When you store data with third party companies, that's what you're doing - not only do they have full access, but you're paying them for the privilege.

### Save thousands and stay in control of your data

With PantherX Central Management, it's a breeze to run your own infrastructure.

- Run server applications like ERP, CRM or Task management yourself with a few clicks
- Select between _Panther Alpha_, or a number of cloud providers _(1000+ Users)_.
- Enjoy faster access speeds, and continue to work when the internet is down
- Automatic backup, at cents per GB

**What if you don't know anything about computers?**

_Have you ever used Gmail before?_ It's easier to run your own server with Central Management, than it is to use a Gmail account. Then again, chances are any business with 10+ people has someone who knows how to plugin a power cord.

**What if our server goes down, or a Panther Alpha fails?**

By default, Central Management keeps backups for everything: User accounts, server applications and itself. Should something go wrong, you can recover from backup in a minute - unless it's Central Management itself - that's more like minute**s**.

Now ask yourself: When was the last time you recovered a critical piece of infrastructure by yourself, and in under 10 minutes?
