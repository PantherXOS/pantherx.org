- Assign employees to one or multiple devices
- Remotely manage installed applications, and pre-set user accounts
- Backup automatically

#### Time tracking built-in

Optionally, you can enable time tracking for each user, to allow for more accurate billing, and answer many important questions including:

- How many hours did we work this week?
- What did we spend most time on? (Application usage reports)
- Where did we do most of our work from? (Location reports)

**Time tracking is completely automatic.**
