In larger cooperations, equipment, licensing, and equipment maintenance can often costs millions per year. Furthermore, when something goes wrong, or a license expires, you'll find that thousands of users, are unable to work for hours.

**All software that ships with PantherX is open source, and does not have any licensing fees.** If a particular feature is missing, it's easy to get this added, either by the original developer, or really any competent third party.

This is also where open source, and closed source software differ: If Microsoft Office is missing a feature, you're out of luck.
