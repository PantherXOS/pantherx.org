The built-in firewall protects your computer both on the system and application level, in- and out-bound. Unused ports are blocked by default, and applications that shouldn't connect, don't.

### System firewall

The system firewall is a low-level firewall that reliably closes ports and prevents all communication, both in and out-bound. It's the first, and most important barrier between your computer, and the outside world.

### Application firewall

Unlike the system firewall, the application firewall can block specific applications from accessing the internet, while keeping the port open for other applications to use.

Together with the system firewall, the application firewall builds an effective barrier between the network (and internet) you're connected to, and your computer. This also reduces unnecessary chatter between individual, 3rd party applications, and developers that want to collect analytics about what you do - not so, on PantherX.
