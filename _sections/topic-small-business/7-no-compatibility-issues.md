Once upon a time Microsoft Office was standard, and people used 1.44MB floppy disks that are approximately 3 times the size of your 32,000,000MB USB stick. Today, **companies from all across the world rely on [Libre Office](/applications/libreoffice/)** to satisfy all their needs - and share 100% Microsoft Office compatible files with everyone that's stuck in the 90's.
