When you're doing serious business, licensing fees can add up easily. OS License, Office, Photoshop, Backup Software, Anti-Virus - not to mention subscription fees for file sync, private chat, and time tracking software.

**Not so, on PantherX**: Most open source software is free and updated regularly.

If you like a particular piece of software, you can support development and even sponsor a new feature. This is also what differentiates open source, from often expensive, proprietary software, where you usually don't have any influence over the product.
