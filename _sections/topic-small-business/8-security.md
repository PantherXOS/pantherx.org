PantherX has been designed to be secure and boost a number of system protection tools, out of the box.

### File encryption

File encryption is essential, whether your Panther Alpha is stationary, or comes with you on the road. With file encryption turned-on, you don't have to worry about displacing your Panther Alpha, because even with physical access, your files are useless, without your password.

### Secure Communication

On PantherX, all communication is always encrypted, and all tools we provide or recommended, allow you to keep in touch, with end-to-end security and without having to sign-up for any accounts.

### Anti-Virus

Most exploits, hacks and viruses won't even run on PantherX, as they majority have been designed to specifically affect Windows PC's - it's simply the most lucrative.

If you're extra careful, and want to help protect co-workers on Windows PC's, you'll find a number of excellent, open source anti-virus applications, which you can use to scan suspicious USB sticks or external HDD.

### Firewall

The built-in system and application firewall, protects you from both incoming attacks, and applications that aren't supposed to connect to the internet. Additionally, PantherX allows you define profiles, depending on your location, and the network you're connected to - to further enhance your security, especially on public WiFi's.
