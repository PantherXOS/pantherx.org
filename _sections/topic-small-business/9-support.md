- Support via email, live chat and phone
- A flexible amount of storage for your encrypted backups

PantherX support is set apart by 2 factors:

1. We can replicate your exact system configuration on our side, to troubleshoot
2. If you're running Panther Alpha, we have the exact same system on our end

We have designed and developed PantherX, PantherX Central Management and Panther Alpha - we know this platform better than you know yourself.
