PantherX OS builds on Linux, which already powers the majority of our today's infrastructure, and various super computers. The whole system has been designed to protect your data and itself, even in {% include tooltip.html keyword="hostile environments" description="These days, your home internet is a hostile environment, with virtually everything and anything, including your computer and the apps you run, tracking or recording you - not so, with PantherX." %}. Take advantage of various security tweaks, such as restricting internet access, or limiting sensitive communication to specific networks.

### Password Manager

PantherX comes with a built-in password manager, that comes with a browser plugin, and syncs to a number of compatible mobile clients on both iPhone and Android. Tools are provided to import your passwords from many popular password managers, including 1Password, Keepass, Lastpass, Roboform and KWallet.

Of course you're free to choose what works best for you and may continue using your existing solution on PantherX.

### Firewall

The built-in Firewall protects your computer both on the system and application level, in- and out-bound. Unused ports are blocked by default, and applications that shouldn't connect, don't.

#### System firewall

The system firewall is a low-level firewall that reliably closes ports and prevents all communication, both in and out-bound.

#### Application firewall

Unlike the system firewall, the application firewall can block specific applications from accessing the internet, while keeping the port open for other applications to use.

Together with the system firewall, it builds an effective barrier between the network (and internet), and your computer, including the applications that run on it.

### Encryption

Files you store on your Panther Alpha are optionally, transparently encrypted, using a personalized encryption key that ties to your login password.

### Visibility & Transparency

PantherX OS keeps track of the current system state, and informs you about any changes. With a clear overview of how you're connected to your network, what services are running and which applications are allowed to access the internet, and how, when and how much they utilize the connection.

More experienced users can define their desired system in a configuration file, and set-up any Panther Alpha, from scratch, and without any additional knowledge - precise and replicable.
