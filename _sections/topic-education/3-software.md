PantherX comes with thousands of apps, many of which cater specifically to schools.

1. Cool apps for students, for a more interactive classroom
2. Useful tools for teachers, to save time and energy
3. Web apps for management, and teachers, to keep track of grades, attendance, and school finances

It's also really easy, to try new things on Panther: Let's assume you're thinking of setting up a **student community forum** - with PantherX and Central Management, you can set-up and kick-off a trial, within an hour, on a spare Panther Alpha, at zero cost.
