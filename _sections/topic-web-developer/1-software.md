![PantherX Desktop](/assets/images/px-desktop-dev@0.5x.jpg)

Everything you'd expect, is available out of the box. This includes build tools, package managers, databases - you name it. Additionally, all packages are build straight from source, without distribution specific changes. If you need something newer, than available in the package repository, simply update the version, in the package definition, and you're good to go.

Of course, we also have all the popular, open source GUI development tools, including Atom.

### Versioned

Your whole system, including all installed packages, are defined in a system configuration file. Any change you make to the configuration, or by installing a new package, is versioned and can be restored, at a later time. In fact, you can transfer your system snapshot from one Panther Alpha, to another, and everything will be configured and installed, according to your previous set-up - down to the version of each individual package.

### No Conflicts

Package conflicts on PantherX are virtually impossible, and everything can be installed both on the user, and system level. On top of that, different users, may run different or multiple versions of each library or application. This works, apart from environments, which further enhance the control you have over installed packaged, and when / how they are used.
