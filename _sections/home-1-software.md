On PantherX OS, all your applications and updates come from one of two sources, similar to an App-Store.

Our primary store, accessible trough **Software**, lists officially approved, rigorously tested applications and plugins. Our secondary, 3rd party store, specifically designed for developers and enterprise, lists all remaining applications, that are either awaiting approval, or are not suitable for the primary store.

Unlike other stores, registration is optional, advertisements and trackers are prohibited and everything has been tested with PantherX, on Panther Alpha.

### Full System Updates

PantherX OS supports full-system updates, which ensure that your computer is secured against the latest threats, and applications you use on daily basis, receive crucial bug fixes and enhancements more frequency and without manual intervention.

Additionally, PantherX never applies an update or installation, till it has completed successfully. If anything goes wrong, du to any number of reasons, including a power outage, your system will not be modified, and you can try again later.

### The tools you need

PantherX connects to the most popular services out of the box. It's easy to set-up your Gmail account, get files synced from Dropbox, start a chat on WhatsApp or connect to a privacy-first VPN provider. Also supported are Microsoft Office documents, and all your pictures, music and videos play as well.
