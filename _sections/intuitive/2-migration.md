On PantherX we have taken special care to accommodate the needs of everyone who's migrating from other systems such as Windows, or MacOS. The Desktop environment is designed to be instantly familiar, and people that usually have trouble migrating to a new platform, will find that PantherX works as expected and everything is in it's usual place.

- Great, free replacement for your existing apps
- No need to learn anything new
- No special skills required

**Can I run my Windows / MacOS application on PantherX?**

Many of the applications you're using today, are already available for PantherX. If you cannot find a particular application, you will most likely discover one with similar features, in [_Software_](/applications/) - with the difference, that it's open source, completely free, and nobody is trying to rip you off (no tracking, no spyware, no ads, ...).
