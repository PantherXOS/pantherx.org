PantherX automatically and transparently blocks {% include tooltip.html keyword="all" description="Our various block lists are maintained publicly, and you decide just how aggressively PantherX blocks undesired advertisements and trackers." %} advertising networks, trackers and malicious sites, system wide. No matter what browser or application you are using, PantherX protects you automatically.

### Built-in Proxy & VPN

Furthermore, PantherX provides tools that help you set-up your own VPN or proxy server, on any other Panther Alpha, or almost any Linux powered cloud server, anywhere in the world.

If you prefer to stick with a reputable provider, select one of many, pre-configured VPN providers, supporting a number of protocols, including OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec and stunnel tunnels.

PantherX is a upstream distribution of the {% include tooltip.html keyword="Guix System Distribution" description="The Guix System Distribution (GuixSD) is an advanced distribution of the GNU operating system developed by the GNU Projectâ€”which respects the freedom of computer users." %}, which has been in development since early 2013 and already found application in universities and high performance computing environments. PantherX OS, including all Panther applications, are open source, and anybody may review, enhance or re-use Panther software. In fact, we encourage adoption in other projects.
