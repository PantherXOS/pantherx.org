- It should be easy for everyone to find, install and use quality open source software that rivals paid alternatives.
- It should be possible to inspect and modify any software that runs on your computer. On PantherX, all software is made available straight from source code, that means that experienced users can inspect how the software works, and what it does, giving everyone additional insurance that the application is safe.

_Some software vendors do not publish their application source code. This software will still run on PantherX, but we will ensure that you know, you are running a potentially unsafe application._
