- **Less waste**: Make Desktop and Laptop upgradable for non-techies.
- **Less drain**: A Panther Alpha plus 21inch screen use less than 35W.
- **Less noise**: A silent computer, and a desktop environment that stays out of the way.

- **More privacy**: A OS that doesn't track you, and apps that don't phone home
- **More performance**: Lightweight apps that focus on key features
- **More accessibility**: Great software that doesn't cost anything, and that you can improve yourself.
- **More decentralization**: Bitcoin was revolutionary, but other tech should follow the foot-steps.
