On PantherX, all your applications and updates come from one of two sources, similar to an App-Store.

#### Primary Store

Our primary store lists over 10,000 officially approved, rigorously tested applications and plugins and can be accessed trough the **Software** application. Here you'll find all your favourite apps, and discover new tools, to make your life easier.

#### Developers Store

Our secondary store, specifically designed for developers and enterprise, lists all remaining applications, that are either undergoing _Beta_ testing, are awaiting approval, or are not suitable for the primary store. The 3rd party store is only accessible via command line or executed trough developer distributed {% include tooltip.html keyword="app packages" description="App Packages are comparable to an installer you might find on Windows or MacOS, with the difference that they are tiny in size and obtain their application code from our secondary store. That means, after installation, they remain up to date, with the rest of the system." %}.

### The Tools you Need

With a powerful {% include tooltip.html keyword="office suite" description="PantherX comes pre-installed with LibreOffice, which includes support for Microsoft Word, Excel and Power Point files." %}, professional {% include tooltip.html keyword="photo editing" description="PantherX comes with a variety of photo editing tools, including the popular Gimp - an open source Adobe Photoshop alternative." %} tools, a sound recording suite and everything to write the next, great app - there's no limit to what you can do.

### No registration, no tracking, no ads

Unlike other stores, registration is optional, advertisements and trackers are prohibited and everything has been tested with PantherX, on {% include tooltip.html keyword="Panther Alpha" description="Panther Alpha is a computer, smaller than your wallet, designed specifically for PantherX." %}.

### Always up to date

PantherX OS supports full-system updates, which ensure that your computer is secured against the latest threats, and applications you use on a daily basis, receive critical bug fixes and enhancements more frequently.
