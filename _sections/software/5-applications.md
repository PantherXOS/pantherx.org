**What is open source and how does it benefit you?**

_Open source_ means that the code of the application is public. Depending on the license, you can actually download the _source code_, to review, or even modify it - for example, to add a new feature.

- With some programming skills, you can add new features to most apps
- Share your improvements with the community and thousands of others benefit
- Rest assured, that the software you are running, doesn't do anything behind your back!

**Is all open source software free?**

Usually. _Open source_ software is often written by individuals or teams, that are unsatisfied with available and often expensive _closed source_ software. A lot of the work is funded trough support subscriptions, and donations by companies that use the software.

Blender is a very impressive example of _open source_ software.
