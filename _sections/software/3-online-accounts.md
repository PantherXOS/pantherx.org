Online accounts can be added, edited and monitored from a unified interface. This covers everything from the essentials such as mail, contacts, calendar, file synchronization and various chat services, to Cryptocurrency wallets and API credentials to access popular exchange services.

#### Secure Password Storage

All secrets, including passwords, tokens and API keys are encrypted and access to individual records is limited to the application that requires it, and has been authorized, during the account set-up.

### Panther Hub

Panther Hub shows all your connected online accounts, their status and related notifications like messages and even account movements, depending on which services you have configured and enabled.
