				On PantherX, the whole system is configured using a system configuration template. Everything that's not user-specific goes into this configuration, and guix makes sure the system remains in this state, every time you reboot, reconfigure or update the system. Specifically, the configuration contains information on how the disk is formatted, how the computer connects to the network, what users exist, what services are running, what packages are installed, and so on.

						Each configured user can independently install packages, and configure their own desktop environment, without elevanted priviliges, but the system configuration is shared between all users.
					</p>
					<p>
						The configuration generated by this script is a good starting point, but you can change it to your liking. If you install PantherX with <code>px-install</code>, the configuration is generated automatically and will look identical to the example below.

						Because this script does not have access to your computer, some information may be incomplete.
