We believes that respect of privacy is of the utmost importance in today's world. Nonetheless, many jurisdictions throughout the world still permit some legitimate or illegitimate authorities to compromise people's privacy in the context of the rules of law. This includes, but is not limited to, the U.S. Patriot Act or the British H.R. 1981. Such laws would provide relevant warrant, search or seizure in the context of criminal investigations, while forbidding the disclosure of such events to the entire affected user base. Warrant canaries have been found to be legal by the United States Justice Department, so long as they are passive in their notifications.
