It seems like forever that we have started working on this but the wait has finally paid-off. On behalf of the entire team, **I'm proud to announce the first beta of PantherX OS**.

### What to expect

This is a beta release, so please keep a few things in mind:

- We do not accept bug reports at this time
- We do not provide support except for occasional forum comments
- We try to release updates on a weekly basis
- We will publish our source repositories on git soonish

With that being said, we are working exclusively on PantherX OS and I myself do virtually everything on the system without any major issues. In fact, after years on MacOS and the months on various other Linux distributions, I have found PantherX to be much more reliable. If you do ever run into any issues after an update, simply reboot and roll-back your system in literally 1 second.

Have a great time on PantherX OS
