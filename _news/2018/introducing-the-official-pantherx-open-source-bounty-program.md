Today we're introducing the new, PantherX Open Source Bounty Program, designed to help us resolve issues faster, and with the help of outside contributors.

If you're a Linux Guru, and either already know about GuixSD, or would like to learn something new, it's easy to contribute:

1. Watch our [Bounty Program](https://git.pantherx.org/bounty) for new entries
2. Pick an entry you'd like to help resolve
3. Submit your solution, using any public repository
4. The first contributor, that submits a working solution, can claim the bounty
5. We release your work, under your name

Most of the work, relates to existing open source projects, and all relevant contributions, will be pushed upstream, benefiting the community as a whole.
