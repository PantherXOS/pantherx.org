As we leave 2018 behind, we reflect on our accomplishments, and what we'd like to achieve this year, not only for ourselves, but the ones we care about.

Most of all, we wish for change in 2019, but I'm afraid it will just be the same, or worse - yet we're presented with an opportunity, to plant a seed, and help empower individuals to break free from evil monopolies, and at the same time, bring much needed opportunities to regions in this world, that have either been neglected, or purposely pushed into chaos - to benefit a few, in the west.

The seed we're planting, is PantherX - a project for all of us - the ones that develop, support and rely on it every day. A community project, as much as it is a commercial project - but not to enrich, but to benefit everyone equally, as Panther community.

Let's make it a great year, for all of us.

Happy New Year 2019!
