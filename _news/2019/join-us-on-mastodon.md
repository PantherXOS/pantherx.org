As we progress towards an initial _Alpha_ release of PantherX OS, we're also hard at work, building a community around PantherX and projects we rely on.

While it's still too early, to launch a full-blown forum, we're going live with our dedicated PantherX Mastodon community today. Here you can discuss everything Linux, share your thoughts about, and wishes for PantherX OS, and get help on Guix related issues.

> Mastodon is a social network based on open web protocols and free, open-source software. It is decentralized like e-mail.

Sign-up at [pantherx.social](https://pantherx.social/) or follow [me](https://pantherx.social/@franz) from your existing Mastodon account.
