It has been a long time since we've made any noise and there really has not been anything exciting happening! Developing a new distribution does not happen over night - much rather, it's a long, tedious grind to get everything ready for prime time.

It's not all bad though! I'm typing this on PantherX OS Alpha 7. It's been a smooth ride, and every update we push and apply, sure feels satisfying. The Desktop has been stable from day one, but many integrations were lacking, and features you would expect from a modern computing environment, simply were not there.

At this moment we are aiming to release something to the public by early 2021. Our primary constraint, and the reason for the delays is time (of course!). We simply do not have the manpower _right now_ to properly handle a public release, including community maintenance and so on... First we need to get our infrastructure ready, then we'll have to setup the proper channels, and finally test our release on more devices.

We also hope to publish more details on our own hardware soon.

Overall, I must say that we will only release, once we are satisfied with what we'd call a "Public Beta". This is by no means a feature complete release, but much rather a glimpse at what's to come. Of course you may already run this on your primary machine, much as we do ourselves. We do not expect anything major to break, but we hope to get it more _ready_ before we dare to call it a "1.0".
