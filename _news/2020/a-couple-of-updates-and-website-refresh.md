2019 has been a packet, yet very satisfying year for us. As we approach our initial release of PantherX, I've put aside some time to add more information to our website.

### PantherX Use-Case

We all have certain expectations towards our computer, and while PantherX is likely to satisfy whatever you need, we've come-up with a number of use-cases, to showcase how it fits in:

- [Home](/at-home/)
- [Small Business](/for-small-business/)
- [Enterprise](/for-business/)
- [Education](/for-education/)

### Screenshots

As our work on the PantherX "App store" _Software_ progresses, we had to collect screenshots for each, available application. In case you're curious, and you really don't know what to expect (or have never seen a Linux application), have a look at [here](/software/#Useful+open+source+applications).

### We're on Matrix now

We've migrated our team chat from _Keybase_ to _Matrix_ and couldn't be happier with the result. You can find our public group [here](https://matrix.to/#/#public:pantherx.org). There's no activity at the moment but if you have a question, please ask.
